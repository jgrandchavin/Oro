# Oro APP

## Author
Julien Grand-Chavin, 23 years old, from France / Switzerland.

## Platform
Oro works with both iOS and Android platform. (Work well on iPhone X and Honor X8).

## Description 
My app localizes you and gives you your localization's AQI (Air quality Index) and you get the information with a shake. 

Here is the different categories of air quality:
- [0:30] : Excellent air quality
- ]30 : 50] : Good air quality
- ]50 : 100] : Moderate air quality
- ]100 : 500] : Low air quality

Each category has one color and one Flare animation (different for each). Don't forget to watch the animation :D  

The app gives you the weather with the temperature and an icon.

PS: I let you some screenshots in the folder to get a view of each case.

## API
I use two API for the project :
- https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse : to get exact location name (Free to use)
- https://api.airvisual.com/v2/nearest_city? : to get the weather and the AQI (I have a free community key limited to 10 000 call per month)


## Thanks
I hope you enjoy my app and congratulations for the Flutter Create, it was fun to do !
