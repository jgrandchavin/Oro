# Oro 

Oro localizes you and gives you your localization's AQI (Air quality Index) and you get the information with a shake. 

Oro was create for Flutter Create contest 2019 first. The aim of this contest was to made an app with Flutter with less thant 5KB of code. (Oro may has been updated since)

## Description 
Here is the different categories of air quality:
- [0:30] : Excellent air quality
- ]30 : 50] : Good air quality
- ]50 : 100] : Moderate air quality
- ]100 : 500] : Low air quality

Each category has one color and one Flare animation (different for each). Don't forget to watch the animation :D  

The app gives you the weather with the temperature and an icon.

## API
I use two API for the project :
- https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse : to get exact location name (Free to use)
- https://api.airvisual.com/v2/nearest_city? : to get the weather and the AQI (I have a free community key limited to 10 000 call per month)
